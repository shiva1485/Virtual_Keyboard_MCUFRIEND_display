This is not a library but a code to run in arduino ide.

This is a demo of the virtual keyboard in the arduino using mcu-friend-3.5inch-display.

The code runs for all the versions of the mcufriend display.

Be sure to change the resolutions of the display or the driver i.e, all model displays of mcufriend except for 3.5inch.

You can try creating a whole phone or some menu type or ipod type ....etc using this code.
